# picDash: SVG to PNG - Seriously Fast! ⚡️

Okay, so I made this thing called picDash. It's pretty simple: it converts SVG files to PNG images. But the _reason_ I made it is because I was constantly frustrated with how slow and clunky other SVG converters were. I just wanted something that was FAST. Like, _really_ fast.

## What's the Deal?

- **Speed Demon:** Seriously, this thing is quick. I've optimized it to be as fast as possible. No waiting around.
- **Free (as in beer):** Yep, totally free. No hidden costs, no watermarks, no BS.
- **Drag & Drop (because who has time for buttons?):** Just drag your SVG file onto the window, and BAM! Instant PNG.
- **Upscale It!:** Need a bigger PNG? Choose a scale factor from the dropdown.
- **Clean & Simple:** I hate cluttered interfaces. picDash is designed to be super easy to use. You won't need a manual.
- **(Hopefully) Works Everywhere:** I've tested it on Windows, Mac & iOS. Let me know if it breaks on your system!

## How to Use It

1.  Go to [picDash](https://picdash.jrsystems.io).
2.  Drag your SVG file onto the "Drag & drop an SVG file here, or click to select one" area. (It's pretty obvious!)
3.  Choose your desired scale factor from the "Scale Factor" dropdown (1x, 2x, 3x, etc.).
4.  Click the "Convert to PNG" button.
5.  Download the Image.

## Why Did I Make This?

Honestly? I was annoyed how everything was either behind a paywall, slow or needed an account. I needed a fast and _free_ SVG to PNG converter, and everything else sucked. So I built my own. Hopefully, you'll find it useful too!

## Bugs? Suggestions?

Let me know! Create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/jrsgroup/picdash). I'm always looking for ways to make picDash even better.
